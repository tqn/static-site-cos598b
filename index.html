<p>We will select a few computer vision topics to explore.
The focus will be on visual recognition, with sample topics including large-scale image classification,
object detection, semantic segmentation, human pose estimation, activity recognition in video and visual question answering.
We will cover each topic in depth, including benchmarking and evaluation, data acquisition and annotation,
successes and failures of classical algorithms, the latest state-of-the-art insights and models,
and promising future directions. Students will be expected to routinely read and present research papers,
with special attention on developing excellent oral and written scientific communication skills.</p>
